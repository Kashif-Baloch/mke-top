## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Puppeteer fails to launch
**Solution:** Already handled in code with proper args

### Issue: Port 3000 in use
**Solution:** Server auto-uses PORT env var on Railway

### Issue: Empty data from scraper
**Solution:** Check Railway logs, may need to increase timeout

### Issue: Railway deployment fails
**Solution:** Ensure package.json has correct start script
